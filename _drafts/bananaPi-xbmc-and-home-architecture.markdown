The **RaspberryPi** is incredible:

    * It handle mails, data, calendar… etc…
    * It's cheap
    * It's quiet, I sometime forgot I have it running in my place

But, it's also single core processor, so we can't expect much when more user are joining the services I provide with it.

A more concrete example is **XBMC media center**. I have two RPi at home, one for **web services** and one for **XBMC**.
And the XBMC one can't play correctly video if it's indexing movie in the same time, and that indexing can take several
minutes.

You can say it's not a big deal, but it's enough to get complains for a grumpy developer like me :)

The solution, I bought a BananaPi and I installed [**Bananian**](www.bananian.org), then **XBMC**.


## The Result ##

Hey, this is a draft, I didn't actually installed those thing, so wait until I test it out :D
