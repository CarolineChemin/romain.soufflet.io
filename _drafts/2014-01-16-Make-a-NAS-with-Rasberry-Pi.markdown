The first step I care about in making my own space on Internet with RPi was storage.

Nothing is possible without data storage, I need :

* Public Data (Shared links, shared albums…)
* Private Documents for users

began to backup configurations files and every home directory.

RPi works very well with backup and private documents, But problems appear when you share videos.
