# How to move your team to the next level

## Introduction

We often hear about great organization with multiple teams, where everyone can
talk to everyone and every piece of information is accessible. We can hear about
*pair programing*, *code review*, *CI* or *CD*.

Yeah, all of this seems so great, but this is happening in **other** companies.
What about my team ? How can I use all of this for our project ? And men, **what
the hell is a CI** ?

It won't be easy, it won't be cheap, but we can work this out, find solution,
and transform your team to achive more.

## Level 0 : Create your team

This first level is more like creating your character before a role-playing
game. Most team I met in my life are not teams, you need to create your team
before anything else.

### What is a team ?

A team is not just several lads hanging arround and sharing a manager. Team
define themselve by interractions, and it implies to create connections between
people.

Those connections will create unexpected behaviour, team member won't work for a
manager, but they will for the sake of the team.

First of all, to create a team with your employee or coworker, you need to give
them responsabilities. Your team needs to embrace the project, it needs to know
exactly the goal behind each actions.

Secondly, defines global objectives, do not assign task to a person, give your
task to the whole team and let the team decide who will do the actual job.

When you put that together, your people will start to work as a team.

### Prepare your team

By default, humans evolved with an **individual mindset**. People in your team
will try to get credit for themselves, they'll try to implement their idea even
if they were proven wrong.

As a team member, you all need to be vigilant and to make sure teams rules are
applied.

For example, in dev team, you can define the following:

* We use a linter to tell if the code is pretty or not
* We have to respect a specific and exhaustive list before submitting our pull
  requests
* We cannot merge our own code, it must be reviewed by at least one another
  person

## Level 1 : Invest on testing

Tests take several forms, *unit tests*, *functionnal tests*, *UI tests*...
etc...

* Invest on tests to gain time is useless
* Invest on test to improve quality is inneficient
* Invest on test to give your team a standard environment

## Little Break

* Little recap

## Level 2 : Team automation

* Automation, once again is not about time
* Automation is your new warden, a robot will make a better arbitre than a human
* Automatiion ensure you comply to teams rules

## Level 3 : CI/CD : Continuous Whatever

* Normal process of developement is Idea > Code > Test > Integrat > Deploy > Feedback
* Automate most of it, using human is to accept error, automation means less errors

## Conclusion

* Concluded
