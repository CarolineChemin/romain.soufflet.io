title: Modernize your team !
---

We often hear about great organization with multiple teams, where everyone can
talk to everyone else and every piece of information is accessible. We can hear
about *pair programing*, *code review*, *CI* or *CD*.

Yeah, all of this seems so great, but this is happening in **other** companies.
What about my team ? How can I use all of this for our project ? And men, **what
the hell is a CI** ?

I was employed in a startup two years ago, where each task has to be delivered
immediately, and every thing was urgent. How can you put all those great tools
without any time allocated to it ?

It won't be easy, it won't be cheap, but we can work this out, find solutions,
and transform **ANY** team to achive more.

For that, I'll take a little analogy, please think about your team as a role
playing game character. This character will increase its power through different
level, and we starting with a level 0, before our game can begin.

## Level 0 : Create your team

This first level is more like creating your character, you know, before you
start your Donjon & Dragon campaign, you have to create your character and
assign some skill points. This is the same with your team.

Most team I met in my life weren't really ones, this is not just several lads
hanging arround and sharing a manager. Team define themselve by interractions,
and it implies to create connections between people.

Those connections will create unexpected behaviour, team member won't work for a
manager, but they will for the sake of the team.

First of all, to create a team with your employee or coworker, you need to give
them responsabilities. Your team needs to embrace the project, it needs to know
exactly the goal behind each actions.

Secondly, defines global objectives, do not assign task to a person, give your
task to the whole team and let the team decide who will do the actual job.

When you put that together, your people will start to work as a team, together,
to solve global problems that makes sense.

## Level 1 : Train your neutral judge

By default, humans evolved with an **individual mindset**. People in your team
will try to get credit for themselves, they'll try to implement their idea even
if they were proven wrong.

:: NOTE :: Create a personality

As a team member, you need to be vigilant and make sure teams rules are applied.

For example, in dev team, you can define the following:

* We use a linter to tell if the code is pretty or not
* We have to respect a specific and exhaustive list before submitting our pull
  requests
* We cannot merge our own code, it must be reviewed by at least one another
  person

All those item **have to be neutral**. No feelings in it, just code. As it is
neutral by definition, nobody can contest its result, every one has to comply.

Another big part of your neutral authority is tests.

Every dev team talks about tests, I saw dozens of wrong way to implement tests,
so today we will clarify things, here the mon common misconception :

* Tests won't help you earning time
* Tests won't improve your product quality
* Tests won't be easy to implement

**Tests will force your team to define a default environment to run your tests**

And once you got that clean environment, and only then, writing tests will be
useful.

## Little Break

Just take a moment to think about first two levels. If you follow this, you'll
have a real team, and a real process to change an idea into code and then commit
that code into the product.

You have now the foundations, you can, and you will add more to your team to
increase its productivity.

But you can't make all of this happen in one day. Try to add item by item, week
by week.

And the most important, get feedback from your team !

## Level 2 : Team automation

Once again, try to focus on what's important for your team. If you try to
automate anything because it'll save you time, it's not the good thing.

Automation is the next level for you **neutral judge**.

I suggest you another approach to automation, do you know this piece of software
called Jenkins ? Try the same for your team, name your **neutral authority**,
Jarvis, HAL, whatever, give it a name.

Now, it has a name, the team will spontaneously give a personnality to your
**neutral authority**, it will become the seed of a new culture, your team's
culture. Where you can grow a lot of private joke.

Let's call it **Timmy** for the rest of this article.

**Timmy** will tell you if your tests pass, or not. He will reject or approved
new pull request.

**Timmy** can update your documentation alone or send email to your customers,
just ask him.


Automation will save time to your team only once it is in place. But it's a new
team member, treat him like that.

Every team I saw putting a CI and impose it to a team have failed, every single
time !

## Level 3 : CI/CD : Continuous Whatever

Now you have a team, and it's a great team, with its own culture, private joke,
identities and legend. And most of all, your team is almost autonomous.

This last level will capitalize on that.

The normal workflow of developement is the following

 Idea => Code => Tests => Integrate => Deploy => Feedback => Back to idea

You don't need a Jenkins or Drone or any other specific tools to make your own
automation, let your team decide from their needs, let them give life to
**Timmy**

The more **Timmy** is developped, the less your team as to work to get from
**Idea** to **Customer feedback**. The team itself will reduce the development
time. and that's the ultimate goal of every **Continuous integration**.

## Conclusion

Managing a team is not an easy skill, every one is different, every one has its
own approach to problem solving. Getting every to work on an idea is really
hard.

But, as every other skill, you can learn to improve your team, accept each
members with their differences, accept their way of thinking. It'll take some
effort, it'll be hard.

As your team is getting stronger, member will get closer and good thing will
spontaneously shows up ! Trust your team ! They are good, they are working hard
too !

Thank you.
