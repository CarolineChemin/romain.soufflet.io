I launch today officialy the Gentux.IO project.

This will handle several aspect of my life and aim to centralize interractions with my friends.

Since I got a good connection at home (arroung 100Mbps), my thought about personnal webservices changed. I can consider
now that anyone can store a little computer in a corner of the living room and forget about it. That's, in my opinion,
the purpose of Rasberry Pi computers.

So I bought one and installed the following services on itÂ :

* IMAP/SMTP
* Web Server
* WebDav Server
* CalDav and CardDav Server
* NFS shares

All services runs correctly using less than 300Mo of RAM (Rasberry Pi has 512Mo available). Services runs prefectly for
me.

The next step is to open webservices access to my family and friends. After that, I will write about performance and how
Rasberry Pi handle those users.
