It's been a long time since my last post. I've been through some difficulties in my professional life and that's why I
didn't had time to worry about my Rasberry Pies.

And I'm glad to see how well they handled their job during this period.

In [my first post](http://romain.soufflet.io/services/life/2014/01/09/Romain-Soufflet-s-blog-oppened.html) I described
what I was planning to install on a single RPi in order to handle all services I needed.

Since that, I openned 3 other accounts for my broser and my two parentsâ€¦ and I forgot about this.

In 4 month, nothing to report, all services are doing well for every account without performance issues. I'll open some
other account for close friends.

I'll try to make a little documentation in the next few week to explain how it works
